# CSA Projects for Nociti CSA
- Technically it can be called the key for all the CSA projects since they got me 100 + extra cred
- Some projects may use libraries/packages which I read the documentation of, only use the same if you understand what they are actually do
  - Not understanding what they do makes using such libraries/packages redundant to learning Java
