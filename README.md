# CSA Projects for Nociti CSA
- Project storage, check code/compare algorithms
  - Some projects may use libraries/packages which I read the documentation of, only use the same if you understand what they are actually do
  - Not understanding what they do makes using such libraries/packages redundant to learning Java
